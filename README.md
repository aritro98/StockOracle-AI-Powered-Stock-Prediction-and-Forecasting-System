## Overview
StockOracle integrates multiple modules to assist investors in making informed decisions:
- **Data Ingestion & Preprocessing**: Efficient extraction, cleaning, and structuring of raw stock data.
- **Trend Prediction**: Applies linear regression models to forecast short-term price movements and issue actionable recommendations.
- **Topic Modeling**: Applies BERTOPIC to analyze financial text data and extract prevailing themes or topics.
- **Forecasting**: Leverages Facebook's Prophet model to predict future stock trends over customizable periods.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: A web-based UI built with Dash and Plotly that displays historical data, predictions, and topic insights interactively.

## Project Workflow
- **Data Collection & Technical Indicator Calculation** (`notebooks/Stock_Trends.ipynb`):
    - **Data Source**: Collected historical stock data for 10 companies using the `yfinance` library over 5 years (from `2020-01-17` to `2025-01-16`).
    - **Technical Indicators**: Calculated key indicators such as `SMA_50`, `SMA_200`, and `RSI` using `pandas_ta`.
    - **Dataset**: Processed data is saved in the file `stock_data_5_years.csv` with engineered features.
- **Textual & Sentiment Data Preparation** (`notebooks/Textual_Data.ipynb`):
    - **Dataset Creation**: Generated textual descriptions and sentiment scores from the `stock_data_5_years.csv` file.
    - **Output**: The refined textual and sentiment data is stored in the CSV file `refined_textual_data`.
- **Topic Modeling with BERTopic** (`notebooks/Topic_Classification.ipynb` + `visualizations/Topic_Visualization.html`):
    - **Topic Representation**: Applied the BERTopic model on the `refined_textual_data.csv` file to extract key topics frequencies and representative keywords.
    - **Insights & Visualization**: Generate interactive HTML visualizations of topic clusters and temporal insights.
- **Forecasting & Dashboard** (`src/*.py`):
    - **data_processor.py**: Reads CSVs, aligns technical & textual features, creates time‑series windows per ticker.
    - **forecasting.py**: Engineers lag and rolling features, fits Holt‑Winters Exponential Smoothing and HistGradientBoostingRegressor, ensembles predictions for all time periods & units, and generates BUY/SELL/HOLD signals based on expected return thresholds.
    - **visualization.py**: Uses Plotly to render historical price charts, forecast intervals, sentiment distribution histograms, and topic bar charts.
    - **app.py**: Streamlit front‑end that ties all modules together allows users to select tickers, view dynamic charts, and get recommendations.

## Key Features
- **Comprehensive Data Collection**:
    - Fetches historical data for 10 companies.
    - Calculates technical indicators (SMA_50, SMA_200, RSI).
- **Rich Textual Insights**  
    - Emotion labeling (excited, disappointed, optimistic, etc.).  
    - Sentiment polarity mapping (bullish=1, bearish=–1, neutral=0).  
- **Advanced Topic Modeling**:
    - Uses BERTOPIC to uncover underlying themes in financial texts.
    - Provides visual insights on topic distribution.
- **Robust Hybrid Forecasting**:
    - Statistical (Holt–Winters) + ML (HistGradientBoosting) ensemble.
    - Dynamic weighting yields smoother long-term stock predictions.
- **Interactive Dashboard**  
    - Streamlit UI with ticker selector, forecast horizon control, and precise confidence details.  
    - Plotly charts for price, forecast, and sentiment distributions.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary language for data analysis and application logic.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For step-by-step data processing.
- **yfinance**: To collect historical stock market data.
- **Pandas & Numpy**: For data manipulation & performing numerical operations.
- **pandas_ta**: For calculating technical indicators like SMA and RSI.
- **BERTopic**: For topic modeling and extraction of textual insights.
- **statsmodels & scikit‑learn**: Holt–Winters exponential smoothing and HistGradientBoostingRegressor both are used for forecasting future stock prices and generate recommendations.
- **Plotly**: For interactive charting.
- **Streamlit**: An interactive dashboard framework.

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUser/StockOracle-AI-Powered-Stock-Prediction-Forecasting-System.git
   cd StockOracle-AI-Powered-Stock-Prediction-Forecasting-System
   ```
2. Create & activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate      # On macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate       # On Windows
   ```
3. Install Dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Generate datasets & visuals
   * Run `notebooks/Stock_Trends.ipynb` to produce `data/stock_data_5_years.csv`.
   * Run `notebooks/Textual_Data.ipynb` to produce `data/refined_textual_data.csv`.
   * Run `notebooks/Topic_Classification.ipynb` to generate `visualizations/Topic_Visualization.html`.

## Usage
### Launch the Streamlit dashboard
   ```bash
   streamlit run src/app.py
   ```
1. Select a stock ticker from the sidebar (e.g. AAPL, MSFT).
2. Select a forecast period and time unit (days / months / years).
3. View historical price chart, forecast price chart and emotion distribution.
4. Take note of the BUY / SELL / HOLD recommendation with confidence score displayed.
